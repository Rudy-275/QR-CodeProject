## Overview

### Frist Project

I've just completed a front-end coding challenge from @frontendmentor! ðŸŽ‰
This is my first project, which I built and deployed. Though it should not be a big deal but I am very
happy and excited. This turned out to be better than I expected. 
I will share more details on what I learnt and challeneges below.

Any suggestions on how I can improve are welcome!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Let's start from the start.
1. I learned how to initialize git. How to push project using git & getting it into GitHub repo. ( I still need to learn technical terms. Forgive me for that.)
2. The proper usage of Position property & Display property. I learned how to use Absolute, Relative, Fixed, Static positions as well as Grid and Flex properties. ( I will surely explore more about them.)
3. Deployment. After repeatedly pushing the updates in GitHub repo, finally the time came when I deployed my project. I used vercel and honestly I was super easy. Easier than I expected.

### Continued development

I would like to perfect it, I don't know why but in the comparision part of website ( The one where we can compare our code with given challenge.) my project looked small. So, I would like to check if  I made any mistake or maybe I set small size on small display. Whatever it is, I will eventually ( if possible ) correct it. 

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Chatgpt really explained me the usage of Positions and Display. Also on it's recommendation I did a small project to understand these properties.
